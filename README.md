# Universal Simplified Mechanics

## Simplified ideas/notes/predictions/model of the universe?

*Warning* : Information may be wrong?

<br/>

### Information

Geometry?

### Matter

Locations with [Information?](#information)

[Concepts?](https://github.com/tboie/universal_phreak_generator?tab=readme-ov-file#system-mechanics-visualization)

### Space

[Matter?](#matter)

### SCAB

Scaling Cell And Boundary (Big Bang/Dark Energy)?

Rename?

See [Mechanism 2 in Nothing to Something?](https://github.com/tboie/universal_phreak_generator?tab=readme-ov-file#mechanism-2)

### Time

System property of [matter?](Matter?)

System updates every rotation or 2 (axis increment) of [SCAB?](#scab)?

### Light Particle

Most common linear moving [matter](#matter) pattern?

### Cosmological Model

Temporally and spatially infinite?

### Cosmic Expansion

Acceleration/deceleration caused by [SCAB?](#scab)

Cell form scales, resolution increases, density changes?

### Cosmological Redshift

Light changes only by colliding with matter?

Light changes with time from layers evolving/new layers added (see [SCAB](#scab))?

### Cosmic Microwave Background

Average smoothing of light from universe mass density changes through time?

Different locations of universe have different measurements?

### Gravity

How information combines as a cell expands?

Combination of system ruleset and [SCAB?](#scab)?

### Absolute Beginning

See [SCAB?](#scab)

### Big Bang & Inflation

Scaling imprecision of calculations likely?

### Shape

Cell?

[Geometry of Locality Diagram layers?](https://github.com/tboie/universal_phreak_generator?tab=readme-ov-file#system-mechanics-visualization)

### Black Holes

More information towards/around a location than emitted from it?

### Dark Matter

True for all matter when layering exists?

### Standard Model

Is particle collision data sufficient?

[See Nothing to Something Sequence?](https://github.com/tboie/universal_phreak_generator?tab=readme-ov-file#nothing-to-something-sequence)

[See Tiling?](https://github.com/tboie/universal_phreak_generator?tab=readme-ov-file#tiles)

### Photons and Neutrinos

Arrangements of [Light Particles?](#light-particle)

See [Dark Matter?](#dark-matter)

### Gravitational Waves

Light pulses of galactic scale?

### Double Slit Experiment

Try this experiment in a perfect environment with absolute precision?

What is the question?

### Entanglement & Bell's Theorem

Experimental inadequacy?

### Probabilities

Unknown knowledge?

### Time Dilation

Structural interference from matter?

### Experimental Problems of Reality

Use virtual experiments?

### Consciousness/Free Will

Arrangement of information?

If there is a base system and sequence that can be reproduced simultaneously, information is complete?

Possible locations [Nothing to Something Mechanisms](https://github.com/tboie/universal_phreak_generator/blob/main/README.md#nothing-to-something-sequence) can be applied?

### Tubes

Form scales from [SCAB?](#scab)

### Aliens

Cataclysmic events more likely?

### Human Location

Middle Corner?

### Cellular Automata

Reasoning/proof this [theory/model](#scab) is impossible as the basis of reality?

### Smallest Resolution Evidence

Smallest layout possible to model the largest and most common pattern of objects?

3x3?

### End of Expansion

When configuration matches inactive state?
