### Light Particle

Most common linear moving [matter](#matter) pattern?

### Dark Matter

[Locality Diagrams?](https://github.com/tboie/universal_phreak_generator?tab=readme-ov-file#system-mechanics-visualization)

### Dark Energy

See [Newer Notes in Nothing to Something?](https://github.com/tboie/universal_phreak_generator?tab=readme-ov-file#newer-notes)

### Scaling Cell and Boundary (Big Bang alternative)

See [Dark Energy?](#dark-energy)

### Cosmological Model

Temporally and spatially infinite?

### Cosmic Expansion

Result of [Dark Energy?](#dark-energy)

Cell form scales, resolution increases, density changes?

### Cosmological Redshift

Light changes only by colliding with matter?

### Cosmic Microwave Background

Average smoothing of light from universe mass density changes through time?

### Gravity

Interaction of moving particles from groups of mass?

Thought experiment: If the sun or planets didn't emit anything, would they still revolve?
