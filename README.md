# Universal Simplified Mechanics

## A simplified interpretation of how the universe works?

*Warning* : Information may be wrong?

<br/>

### Matter

Locations with information?

### Space

Locations with information create space?

### Gravity

If locations without information don't curve, try visualizing gradients of mass interacting with each other?

Thought experiment: If the sun didn't emit anything and the planets had no atmosphere, would they still revolve?

### Dark Matter

Light/moving particles from matter having properties not detectable with current technology?

Light/moving particles from matter that is intercepted while travelling towards the observer?

Matter that doesn't reflect/emit light/moving particles towards the observer?

### Black Holes

See dark matter and gravity sections?

### Gravitational Lensing

The eclipsing of galaxies?

### Gravitational Waves

Pulses of light?

### Spiral Galaxies

Is shape change or spin rotation faster?

### Dark Energy

Unknown matter?

### Inverse Square

Most consistent mathematical pattern?

### Consciousness

Arrangement of light?

### Double Slit Experiment

Try this experiment in a perfect environment with absolute precision?

What is the question?

### Time

Property of the system?

### Probabilities

Unknown knowledge?

### Experimental Problems of Reality

Use virtual experiments?
