# Universal Simplified Mechanics

## A simplified interpretation of how the universe works?

*Warning* : Information may be wrong?

<br/>

### Matter

Locations with information?

[Concepts?](https://github.com/tboie/universal_phreak_generator?tab=readme-ov-file#system-mechanics-visualization)

### Space

Locations with information create space?

### Empty space

Nothing?

### Time

System property?

### Gravity

Try visualizing gradients of mass interacting with each other?

Thought experiment: If the sun didn't emit anything and the planets had no atmosphere, would they still revolve?

### Dark Matter

Light/moving particles from matter having properties not detectable with current technology?

Light/moving particles from matter that is intercepted while travelling towards the observer?

Matter that doesn't reflect/emit light/moving particles towards the observer?

### Dark Energy

Unknown matter?

### Black Holes

Forms from more streaming light intersecting towards a location than moving away from it?

See dark matter and gravity sections?

### Big Intersection (Big Bang alternative)

Intersection of light from other locations on the infinite plane?

### Cosmological Principle

Multitropic? (isotropic & anisotropic)

### Cosmic Expansion

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expansion_of_the_universe

Lol 1 location measurement?

### Gravitational Lensing

Eclipsing of galaxies?

### Gravitational Waves

Galactic sized pulses of light?

### Spiral Galaxies

Does form change more quickly than rotation?

### Z-Axis

Emergent?

Two dimensions at smallest scale almost unimaginable?

### Inverse Square

Most consistent mathematical pattern?

### Double Slit Experiment

Try this experiment in a perfect environment with absolute precision?

What is the question?

### Probabilities

Unknown knowledge?

### Experimental Problems of Reality

Use virtual experiments?

### Consciousness

Arrangement of light/information?
