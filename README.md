# Universal Simplified Mechanics

## Simplified ideas/notes/predictions/model of the universe?

*Warning* : Information may be wrong?

<br/>

### Information

Geometry?

### Matter

Locations with [Information?](#information)

[Concepts?](https://github.com/tboie/universal_phreak_generator?tab=readme-ov-file#system-mechanics-visualization)

### Space

[Matter?](#matter)

### Scaling Cell and Boundary (Big Bang alternative)

See [Dark Energy?](#rotating-boundary-dark-energy)

### Rotating Boundary (dark energy?)

Rename?

See [Newer Notes in Nothing to Something?](https://github.com/tboie/universal_phreak_generator?tab=readme-ov-file#newer-notes)

### Time

System property of [matter?](Matter?)

System updates every rotation or 2 (axis increment) of [boundary?](#rotating-boundary-dark-energy)

### Light Particle

Most common linear moving [matter](#matter) pattern?

### Cosmological Model

Temporally and spatially infinite?

### Cosmic Expansion

Result of [Dark Energy?](#rotating-boundary-dark-energy)

Cell form scales, resolution increases, density changes?

### Cosmological Redshift

Light changes only by colliding with matter?

Light changes with time(layers evolving/new layers)?

### Cosmic Microwave Background

Average smoothing of light from universe mass density changes through time?

Different locations of universe have different measurements?

### Gravity

Systematic Perspective:
Pattern of functionality at scale/time range(s) from changing geometric form of cell?

Modular Perspective:
Interaction of moving particles from groups of mass?

Thought experiment: If the sun or planets didn't emit anything, would they still revolve?

Does empty space know how to curve?

### Smallest Resolution Evidence

Smallest layout possible to model the largest and most common pattern of objects?

3x3?

### 3 Dimensional Experience

[Geometry of Locality Diagram layers?](https://github.com/tboie/universal_phreak_generator?tab=readme-ov-file#system-mechanics-visualization)

### Absolute Beginning

See [Dark Energy?](#rotating-boundary-dark-energy)

### Big Bang & Inflation

Scaling imprecision of calculations likely?

### Black Holes

More information towards/around a location than emitted from it?

### Dark Matter

True for all matter when a z-axis exists?

### Photons and Neutrinos

Arrangements of [Light Particles?](#light-particle)

### Gravitational Waves

Light pulses of galactic scale?

### Double Slit Experiment

Try this experiment in a perfect environment with absolute precision?

What is the question?

### Entanglement & Bell's Theorem

Experimental inadequacy?

### Probabilities

Unknown knowledge?

### Time Dilation

Structural interference from matter?

### Experimental Problems of Reality

Use virtual experiments?

### Consciousness

Arrangement of light/information?

### Aliens

Cataclysmic events more likely?
