*Warning* : Information may be wrong?

<br/>

### Information

Geometry?

### Space

Locations?

### Matter

Locations with information?

[Concepts?](https://github.com/tboie/universal_phreak_generator?tab=readme-ov-file#system-mechanics-visualization)

### Time

System property?

### Light Particle

Most common linear moving particle?

### Dark Matter

[Locality Diagrams?](https://github.com/tboie/universal_phreak_generator?tab=readme-ov-file#system-mechanics-visualization)

### Dark Energy

See [Newer Notes in Nothing to Something?](https://github.com/tboie/universal_phreak_generator?tab=readme-ov-file#newer-notes)

### Rotating Cell Boundary Reduction (Big Bang Alternative)

See [Dark Energy?](#dark-energy)

### Cosmological Model

Temporally and spatially infinite?

### Cosmic Expansion

Result of [Dark Energy?](#dark-energy)

Possible inwards and outwards growth depending on layer size and time?

### Hubble's Law

Change of universe mass density more than galactic distance?

See [Cosmic Expansion?](#cosmic-expansion)

### Cosmic Microwave Background

Average smoothing of light from universe mass density changes through time?

### Gravity

Interaction of moving particles from groups of mass?

Thought experiment: If the sun or planets didn't emit anything, would they still revolve?

Does empty space know how to curve?

### Smallest Resolution Evidence

Smallest layout possible to model the largest and most common pattern of objects?

3x3?

### 3 Dimensional Experience

[Locality diagram layers?](https://github.com/tboie/universal_phreak_generator?tab=readme-ov-file#system-mechanics-visualization)

### Absolute Beginning

See [Dark Energy?](#dark-energy)

### Black Holes

More information towards/around a location than emitted from it?

### Spiral Galaxies

Form changes more quickly than rotation?

### Photons and Neutrinos

Arrangements of [Light Particles?](#light-particle)

### Gravitational Waves

Light pulses of galactic scale?

### Double Slit Experiment

Try this experiment in a perfect environment with absolute precision?

What is the question?

### Entanglement & Bell's Theorem

Experimental inadequacy?

### Probabilities

Unknown knowledge?

### Time Dilation

Structural interference from matter?

### Experimental Problems of Reality
