# Universal Simplified Mechanics

## A simplified interpretation of how the universe works?

*Warning* : Information may be wrong?

### Light

Light particles are not empty space and have mass?

### Gravity

If empty space doesn't curve because it's empty, try visualizing gradients of mass interacting with each other?

Thought experiment: If the sun didn't emit anything and the planets had no atmosphere, would they still revolve?

### Dark Matter

Light from matter that is intercepted while travelling towards the observer?

Matter that doesn't reflect/emit light towards the observer?

### Gravitational Lensing

The eclipsing of galaxies?

### Spiral Galaxies

Is shape change or spin rotation faster?

### Dark Energy

Empty space is empty and has no energy?

Interaction of matter near the edges pulling everything outwards?

### Inverse Square

Most consistent mathematical pattern?

### Consciousness

Arrangement of light?

### Double Slit Experiment

Try this experiment in a perfect environment with absolute precision?

What is the question?
