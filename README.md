# Universal Simplified Mechanics

## Simplified model/predictions of the universe?

*Warning* : Information may be wrong?

<br/>

## Information

Geometry?

### Matter

Locations with information?

[Concepts?](https://github.com/tboie/universal_phreak_generator?tab=readme-ov-file#system-mechanics-visualization)

### Space

Locations with information create space?

### Empty Space

Locations with no information?

### Time

System property?

### Light Particle

Most common linear moving particle

### Gravity

Does empty space know how to curve?

Interaction of moving particles from groups of mass?

Thought experiment: If the sun or planets didn't emit anything, would they still revolve?

### Dark Matter

Light/moving particles from matter having properties not detectable with current technology?

Light/moving particles from matter that is intercepted while travelling towards the observer?

Matter that doesn't reflect/emit light/moving particles towards the observer?

[Locality Diagrams?](https://github.com/tboie/universal_phreak_generator?tab=readme-ov-file#system-mechanics-visualization)

### Dark Energy

See [Newer Notes in Nothing to Something?](https://github.com/tboie/universal_phreak_generator?tab=readme-ov-file#newer-notes)

### Black Holes

More information towards/around a location than emitted from it?

### Spiral Galaxies

Form changes more quickly than rotation?

### Rotating Cell Perimeter Reduction (Big Bang Alternative)

See [Dark Energy?](#dark-energy)

### Cosmological Model

Temporally and spatially infinite?

### Cosmic Expansion

Result of [Dark Energy?](#dark-energy)

Time dependent inwards and outwards?

### Hubble's Law

Galaxies are growing more than distance change?

See [Cosmic Expansion?](#cosmic-expansion)

### Cosmic Microwave Background

Average smoothing point of light from universe mass density?

### Gravitational Waves

Light pulses of galactic scale?

### Smallest Resolution Evidence

Smallest layout the largest and most common pattern of objects can be represented?

3x3?

### Z-Axis

Emergent at scale from 2D structures?

Example: rotational direction of light?

[Is cell information vertically assembled?](https://github.com/tboie/universal_phreak_generator?tab=readme-ov-file#system-mechanics-visualization)

### Absolute Beginning

See [Dark Energy?](#dark-energy)

### Time Dilation

Structural interference from matter?

### Photons and Neutrinos

Arrangements of light particles

### Gravitational Lensing

Eclipsing of galaxies?

### Double Slit Experiment

Try this experiment in a perfect environment with absolute precision?

What is the question?

### Entanglement

Experimental inadequacy?

### Probabilities

Unknown knowledge?

### Experimental Problems of Reality

Use virtual experiments?

### Consciousness

Arrangement of light/information?
