# Universal Simplified Mechanics

## Simplified model/predictions of the universe?

*Warning* : Information may be wrong?

<br/>

## Information

Geometry?

### Matter

Locations with information?

[Concepts?](https://github.com/tboie/universal_phreak_generator?tab=readme-ov-file#system-mechanics-visualization)

### Space

Locations with information create space?

### Empty Space

Does cell information resonate towards infinity?

Nothing?

### Time

System property?

### Gravity

Does empty space know how to curve?

Interaction of light from groups of mass?

Thought experiment: If the sun or planets didn't emit anything, would they still revolve?

### Dark Matter

Light/moving particles from matter having properties not detectable with current technology?

Light/moving particles from matter that is intercepted while travelling towards the observer?

Matter that doesn't reflect/emit light/moving particles towards the observer?

### Dark Energy

Unknown matter?

### Black Holes

More light intersecting towards/around a location than emitted from it?

See dark matter and gravity sections?

### Spiral Galaxies

Form changes more quickly than rotation?

### Big Intersection (Local Big Bang alternative)

Intersection of light from other locations on the infinite plane?

### Cosmological Model

Temporally and spatially infinite?

### Cosmic Expansion

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expansion_of_the_universe

Lol 1 location measurement?

### Hubble's Law

Should there be red-shift correlations for measurements directed North/South/East/West?

Modification of light pattern from collisions?

### Gravitational Waves

Light pulses of galactic scale?

### Z-Axis

Emergent at scale from 2D structures?

[Is cell information vertically assembled?](https://github.com/tboie/universal_phreak_generator?tab=readme-ov-file#system-mechanics-visualization)

### Absolute Beginning

Was there a sequence to the expansion of locational information?

### Time Dilation

Structural interference from matter?

### Gravitational Lensing

Eclipsing of galaxies?

### Double Slit Experiment

Try this experiment in a perfect environment with absolute precision?

What is the question?

## Entanglement

Experimental inadequacy?

### Probabilities

Unknown knowledge?

### Experimental Problems of Reality

Use virtual experiments?

### Consciousness

Arrangement of light/information?
