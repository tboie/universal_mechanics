# Universal Simplified Mechanics

## A simplified interpretation of how the universe works?

*Warning* : Information may be wrong?

<br/>

### Space

Locations with information create space?

### Light

Light particles are not empty space and have mass?

### Gravity

If empty space doesn't curve because it's empty, try visualizing gradients of mass interacting with each other?

Thought experiment: If the sun didn't emit anything and the planets had no atmosphere, would they still revolve?

### Dark Matter

Light and moving particles from matter having properties not detectable with current technology?

Light and moving particles from matter that is intercepted while travelling towards the observer?

Matter that doesn't reflect/emit light and moving particles towards the observer?

### Black Holes

See dark matter and gravity sections?

### Gravitational Lensing

The eclipsing of galaxies?

### Gravitational Waves

Pulses of light?

### Spiral Galaxies

Is shape change or spin rotation faster?

### Dark Energy

Empty space is empty and has no energy?

Behavior of matter beyond view?

### Inverse Square

Most consistent mathematical pattern?

### Consciousness

Arrangement of light?

### Double Slit Experiment

Try this experiment in a perfect environment with absolute precision?

What is the question?

### Time

Property of the system?

### Probabilities

Unknown knowledge?

### Experimental Problems of Reality

Use virtual experiments?
